    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a 24 year old digital marketer from south London. I have been working in digital marketing for the last 7 months. Before that I worked as a language assistant for 9 months in Hamburg, Germany.</p>
    <p>I did a degree in modern languages between 2017 and 2021. I studied German and Russian languages and cultures, and on my year abroad I went to Jena, Germany for 4 months and Moscow, Russia for 6 weeks (I went in 2020, so after 6 weeks the pandemic hit and I had to fly back to the UK).</p>
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>Since the age of 8 I have been involved with music in some way or another, and it is one of my favourite forms of entertainment. At the moment I am a between choirs, but I have spent most of the last decade and a half in a choir of some form, whether it be a church choir, school choir or university choir.</p>
    <p>I have also taken part in music through learning musical instruments. During my schooling I took up both the violin and viola, and progressed up to grade 6 in the violin. I have a violin that I still occasionally practice with now, as well as a keyboard (but sadly no viola currently).</p>
    <h3>Theatre</h3>
    <p>Since returning to the UK in 2022, and especially in the last 6 months, I have been taking more of an interest in theatre productions. My first play was in late 2022, and it was a production of Shakespeare's As You Like It. Shakespeare is much more entertaining in theatres than how we studying it, and this was the performance that allowed me to realise it.</p>
    <p>The most recent production that I saw was <a href="https://southwarkplayhouse.co.uk/productions/under-the-kunde-tree/">Under The Kunde Tree</a> at Southwark Playhouse. This play was an insight into the secret cameroonian independence war against the French in the 1950s. This type of play especially delights me, as it is a very interesting format to be introduced to and learn more about different parts of history, and I was fascinated by a struggle of independence that I never knew even existed.</p>
